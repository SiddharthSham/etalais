            <p class="mb-4 mt-5">I didn't see the girl with the red umbrella after that. I didn't have occassion to, preoccupied as I was with my day job.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">I couldn't thank her for the kind gesture she made, leaving an angst-stricken person with a loaf of hope.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">I wouldn't have been able to tell her even if I could. But I was working on it.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Some day, I told myself. Some day I would meet her again and I would finally pay her back. I never had liked holding debts with people.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">I would tell her, perhaps over a cup of cocoa, how much I admired the service she was doing at the soup kitchen. I would ask her if she knew how happy and radiant she made those surrouning her, with her thoughtful gestures and uplifting words.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">I would exalt her spirit and poise and confidence, in plain and simple tones. How I aspired to emulate those very qualities. I knew I wouldn't flatter. I knew I'd stay silent after that. She would be uncomfortable with the attention, truly mortified.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Most importantly, I had this sense that she would need a listening ear at some point in time. Not anytime soon though. It was too quick of a time frame since... Well, it wasn't the best time for her. Or for me. And selfish as that sounded, and as much as I wanted to be that friend, I needed to work on myself first before I could ever find her. If at all.</p>
