Warm brown eyes smiled inquisitely as she shot a glance at my newest acquisition. I said nothing.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">Freezing flecks of water slapped my cheeks as the wind grew stronger, picking up leaves and bits of gravel. I was almost drenched, soaking wet, freezing to the bone, and I just wanted some cocoa.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">I couldn't ask her to step aside. Furrows crested her forehead as she wondered why I didn't respond to her offering of a warm loaf of bread. How could I tell her I couldn't accept it?</p>\r\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">I moved away, sidestepping her and moving across the street, shuffling quickly, wanting to get out of the rain. I'd wanted to meet this girl for a while, but now that the moment had come, I realised I wasn't ready. It just wasn't the right time.\r\n            </p><p class=\"mb-4\">I reached the door of the cafe and moved to push it open, but the door seemed stuck. I jostled the knob a bit, and rubbed away the mist settled on the glass. The barista was behind the counter, wiping down the trays and closing up. The cafe was closed. I was too late.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">Anger filled my blood. Rage sought colour in my cheeks, boiling to the extent that my face couldn't feel the cold much more. And then a wave of sadness, of uselessness, crashed over me. Hot tears welled up behind my eyes, not spilling out but holding their own, and I choked down a salty hard lump in my throat.</p>    \r\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">My hands curled into fists as I turned back to the rain and to my accidental companion in the realm of today. But there wa no sign of the red umbrella, or the sunny girl who carried it. Instead, on one of the outdoor cafe tables, protected from Nature's cold wetness by a lot of tinfoil, was a warm loaf of bread with cheese and garlic.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"content\" style=\"text-align:end;\">~ The Nerdy Snickerdoodle</div>\r\n        <div class=\"container-fluid\">\r\n            <a rel=\"preload\" href=\"/4145978e92cf0df765a67180b3509650.html\" class=\"flip\" style=\"left:20%;\">↞ Back</a>\r\n            <a rel=\"preload\" href=\"/dc56d128bd428de7588606b21f410742.html\" class=\"flip\" style=\"right:20%;\">Next ↠</a>\r\n        </div>\r\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\" id=\"pad\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n<script src=\"/883bac9eba8e57445d4cd2bc2b210c44.js\"></script>\r\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"6f6fdef26c807b937b028906dc577de1","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
