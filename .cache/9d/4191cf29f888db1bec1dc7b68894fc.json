I didn't have occassion to, preoccupied as I was with my day job.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">I couldn't thank her for the kind gesture she made, leaving an angst-stricken person with a loaf of hope.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">I wouldn't have been able to tell her even if I could. But I was working on it.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">Some day, I told myself. Some day I would meet her again and I would finally pay her back. I never had liked holding debts with people.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">I would tell her, perhaps over a cup of cocoa, how much I admired the service she was doing at the soup kitchen. I would ask her if she knew how happy and radiant she made those surrouning her, with her thoughtful gestures and uplifting words.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">I would exalt her spirit and poise and confidence, in plain and simple tones. How I aspired to emulate those very qualities. I knew I wouldn't flatter. I knew I'd stay silent after that. She would be uncomfortable with the attention, truly mortified.</p>\r\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">Most importantly, I had this sense that she would need a listening ear at some point in time. Not anytime soon though. It was too quick of a time frame since... Well, it wasn't the best time for her. Or for me. And selfish as that sounded, and as much as I wanted to be that friend, I needed to work on myself first before I could ever find her. If at all.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        <div class=\"content\" style=\"text-align:end;\">~ The Nerdy Snickerdoodle</div>\r\n        <a rel=\"preload\" href=\"/4145978e92cf0df765a67180b3509650.html\" class=\"flip\">↞ Back</a>\r\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\" id=\"pad\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n<script src=\"/883bac9eba8e57445d4cd2bc2b210c44.js\"></script>\r\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"be6e27623f08c34f51d1a0014a6bef99","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
