            <p class="mb-4 mt-5">She didn't see me, but I was there. I wasn't following her but she just seemed to be there always, wherever I was. Figures. Small towns never do keep secret strangers hidden.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Today, it rained. The girl with the bright red umbrella sat at a table outside the cafe, sheltered from the chilly watersplashing down on passers-by.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Across the street was the bookstore. And I was there, prowling the aisles for a new adventure. After hours of pertinent searching and impertinent requests to the store owner, I finally had in my hands a copy of ' Etalais', an obscure magical find in a dusty corner of the dimly lit world of words.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">My stomach grumbled. I needed food. The book carefully wrapped in my jacket, I pushed open the door of the bookstore. The rain had turned into sleet, a torrential downpour obscuring vision and raining icy mists from the asphalt.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">I knew there'd be no motor vehicles down this road, so I trudged on head down, tucking my jacket protectively over the worn cover of my new book. The mists in front of me suddenly seemed disturbed.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">I looked up.</p><p class="mb-4"> She was there, just two feet away. red umbrella clutched tightly in hand covering the head. her brown satchel flap slightly open exposing half a loaf of delicious Romanesque garlic bread with cheese wrapped in tinfoil, and there, as I snuck another look, the faded cover of a favourite novel, very similar to mine : <br><br> ' Etalais' .</p>
